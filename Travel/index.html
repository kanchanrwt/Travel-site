            <p>Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside. Walking for pleasure
                developed in Europe during the eighteenth century. Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer but
                they involve walking long distances for a spiritual purpose associated with specific religions."Hiking"
                is the preferred term in Canada and the United States; the term "walking" is used in these regions for
                shorter, particularly urban walks. In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, the word "walking"
                describes all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in the park or backpacking in the Alps. The word
                hiking is also often used in the UK, along with rambling, hillwalking, and fell walking (a term mostly
                used for hillwalking in northern England). The term bushwalking is endemic to Australia, having been
                adopted by the Sydney Bush Walkers club in 1927. In New Zealand a long, vigorous walk or hike is
                called tramping. It is a popular activity with numerous hiking organizations worldwide, and studies
                suggest that all forms of walking have health benefits</p>

            <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="grid2">

            <p>Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving whereby divers use breathing equipment that is completely
                independent of a surface breathing gas supply, and therefore has a limited but variable endurance.[1]
                The name scuba is an anacronym for "Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus" and was coined by
                Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent submitted in 1952. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing
                gas, usually compressed air,[2] affording them greater independence and movement than surface-supplied
                divers, and more time underwater than free divers.[1] Although the use of compressed air is common, a
                gas blend with a higher oxygen content, known as enriched air or nitrox, has become popular due to the
                reduced nitrogen intake during long or repetitive dives. Also, breathing gas diluted with helium may be
                used to reduce the effects of nitrogen narcosis during deeper dives.</p>

            <img src="bungee.jpg">
            <p>Bungee jumping spelled bungy jumping, is an activity that involves a person jumping
                from a great height while connected to a large elastic cord. The launching pad is usually erected on a
                tall structure such as a building or crane, a bridge across a deep ravine, or on a natural geographic
                feature such as a cliff. It is also possible to jump from a type of aircraft that has the ability to
                hover above the ground, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter. The thrill comes from the free-falling
                and the rebound.[1] When the person jumps, the cord stretches and the jumper flies upwards again as the
                cord recoils, and continues to oscillate up and down until all the kinetic energy is dissipated.</p>

        <p>Ice skating, the recreation and sport of gliding across an ice surface on blades fixed to the bottoms of
            shoes (skates). The activity of ice skating has given rise to two distinctive sports: figure skating, which
            involves the performance of various jumps, spins, and dance movements; and speed skating and short-track
            speed skating, both of which are forms of racing on ice skates. Ice hockey is the best-known team sport that
            involves skating.</p>
